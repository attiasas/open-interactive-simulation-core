### States

Every simulation is composed of a set of `IState` instances, each identified by an ID. These states dictate screen rendering and updates.
Every OIS project must implement at least one state. You have two options:

* Extend the `SimpleSimulation` class, which incorporates fundamental features and configurations from this library, enabling you to concentrate on content.
* Implement the `IState` interface to define all simulation configurations, behavior, and content yourself.

The `StateManager` engine oversees the active state in the simulation. You can utilize it to establish relationships between your simulation states:
1. Switch between states, clearing the active state stack.
2. Append a new sub-state to the active stack.

```java
public class MenuState implements IState {
    public void startSimulation() {
        // exit() all active states in the stack and enter() new state
        OIS.engine.states.changeState("simulationState");  
    }  
  
    public void openSettings() {
        // pause() the current state and enter() a new state.
        // When the new state exits(), it will trigger this state's resume()
        OIS.engine.states.pushSubState("settingsMenuState");
    }         
}
```
